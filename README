RConfig
=============
by Rahmal Conda - http://www.rahmalconda.com

 * RConfig provides a dottable, hash, array, and argument access to YAML 
   configuration files
 * Implements multilevel caching to reduce disk accesses
 * Overlays multiple configuration files in an intelligent manner


Requirements
============

Currently you need all of those things to get Gullery to run:

 * Ruby -v of 1.8.2 (25-05-2004) or greater.
 * A database that is supported by Rails migrations.
 * Ruby drivers for your database.
 * For best performance, you should have a web server running either
   Apache or Lighttpd along with FastCGI, although these aren't
   strictly required--you can use Ruby's built-in web server for
   low-volume testing.
