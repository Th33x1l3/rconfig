RConfig is a Ruby library that manages configuration within Ruby applications. It bridges the gap between yaml, xml, and key/value based properties files, by providing a centralized solution to handle application configuration from one location. It provides the simplicity of hash-based access, that Rubyists have come to know and love, supporting your configuration style of choice, while providing many new features, and an elegant API.\r\n\r\n### features\r\n* Simple, easy to install and use.\r\n* Supports yaml, xml, and properties files.\r\n* Yaml and xml files support infinite level of configuration grouping.\r\n* Properties files support git config-like configuration grouping.\r\n* Intuitive dot-notation ‘key chaining’ argument access.\r\n* Simple well-known hash/array based argument access.\r\n* Implements multilevel caching to reduce disk access.\r\n* Short-hand access to ‘global’ application configuration, and shell environment.\r\n* Cascades multiple configuration files to support environment and host-specific configuration.\r\n* On-load callbacks for single, multiple, or any config file.\r\n* Embedded ruby code with ERB templating.\r\n* Support for referencing values in property files (Yaml also has built in support using node anchors).\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\n#### Rails Apps\r\nRConfig is released as a Ruby Gem. The gem is to be installed within a Ruby on Rails 3 application. To install, simply add the following to your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    # Gemfile\r\n    gem 'rconfig'\r\n\r\nAfter updating your bundle, run the installer\r\n\r\n    $> rails generate rconfig:install\r\n\r\nThe installer creates an initializer used for configuring defaults used by RConfig\r\n\r\n#### Non-Rails Apps\r\nIf you're not using RConfig in a Rails app, and you don't use Gemfile you can install RConfig with RubyGems\r\n\r\n    gem install rconfig\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nStarting with version 0.4.0, RConfig requires at least Ruby 1.9, and Rails 3. Previous versions can be used in Ruby 1.8 and Rails 2.2+. Non-rails projects need ActiveSupport (>= 3 for RConfig 0.4.0, and > 2.2 for RConfig 0.3).\r\n\r\n* Ruby 1.9\r\n* RubyGems 1.3.5+\r\n* ActiveSupport 3.0+\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n    shell/console =>\r\n      export LANG=en\r\n\r\n    demo.yml =>\r\n      server:\r\n        address: host.domain.com\r\n        port: 81\r\n        host: <%= %x{host_name} %>\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n    application.properties =>\r\n      debug_level=verbose\r\n      app_root=/home/rahmal/apps/rconfig\r\n      test_root=%{app_root}/tests\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n    demo.rb => \r\n      require 'rconfig'\r\n      RConfig.load_paths = ['$HOME/config', '#{APP_ROOT}/config', '/demo/conf']\r\n      RConfig.demo[:server][:port] => 81\r\n      RConfig.demo.server.address  => 'host.domain.com'\r\n      RConfig.demo.server.host     => 'host.local'\r\n\r\n      RConfig.application.test_root => '/home/rahmal/apps/rconfig/tests'\r\n\r\n      RConfig[:debug_level] => 'verbose'\r\n      RConfig[:lang] => 'en'\r\n\r\n### Bugs and Feature Requests\r\n* Bug Reports & Feature Requests: Please use to the [Issues page](https://github.com/rahmal/rconfig/issues)\r\n* Want to Contribute?
